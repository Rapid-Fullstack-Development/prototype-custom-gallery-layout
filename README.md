# prototype-custom-gallery-layout

A prototype to learn how to create a basic photo gallery layout algorithm. As soon as I learned what I need to learn I stopped working on this prototype. I learned what I wanted to learn and then threw away this code - only taking my knowledge with me on to the real production version of Photosphere.

This code was created during a [live stream](https://youtu.be/v0JHiIRm3mY) to support the book [Rapid Fullstack Development](https://rapidfullstackdevelopment.com/).
